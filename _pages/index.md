# Pluginized QUIC
Pluginized QUIC is a framework that enables QUIC clients
and servers to dynamically exchange protocol plugins that extend
the protocol on a per-connection basis.

**August 2020 update**: Pluginized QUIC is now updated to the latest QUIC
specification (draft-29). A test endpoint is available at test.pquic.org:443.

All the source code of this project is available [on GitHub][pquic-github].
